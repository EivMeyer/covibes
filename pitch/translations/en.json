    "content": "There's a new kind of coding I call <span class=\"highlight-vibe\">\"vibe coding\"</span>, where you <span class=\"highlight-key\">fully give in to the vibes</span>, embrace exponentials, and <span class=\"highlight-key\">forget that the code even exists</span>. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I <span class=\"highlight-key\">barely even touch the keyboard</span>. I ask for the dumbest things like \"decrease the padding on the sidebar by half\" because I'm too lazy to find it. I \"Accept All\" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - <span class=\"highlight-key\">I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff</span>, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works."

      "paragraph1": "When a senior developer gets laid off because AI can do 70% of their job, they don't go looking for another job. They realize they can now build an entire SaaS product in a weekend. They grab their designer friend who also got laid off, and maybe a sales person who's tired of selling someone else's dream.",
      "paragraph2": "A 3-person team with AI can ship what used to take a 20-person team six months. But here's the catch: these micro-teams need to move at light speed. They're racing against thousands of other micro-teams with the same AI access.",

Every downsized team of 3 can now compete with companies of 30. The barrier to starting something has gone from $100k and 6 months to $20 and a weekend."
