  - Clear terms about what Covibes can/cannot do with code
  - Respect repository licenses
  - Never claim ownership of user code
- **Severity**: High

### Webhook Security
- **Risk**: Webhook endpoints could be exploited
- **Mitigation**: Implement webhook signature verification, rate limiting
- **Severity**: Medium

## 2. Docker Usage Considerations

### License Compliance
- **Risk**: Docker Desktop has commercial use restrictions
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use Docker Engine (Apache 2.0) for production
  - Review Docker subscription requirements for business use
  - Consider alternatives like Podman if needed
- **Severity**: Medium

### Container Security & Isolation
- **Risk**: Malicious code execution in containers affecting host/other users
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement proper container isolation (user namespaces, seccomp)
  - Resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)
  - Regular security updates
  - Container scanning for vulnerabilities
- **Severity**: High

### Image Distribution
- **Risk**: Distributing images with proprietary software or malware
- **Mitigation**:
  - Build images from scratch or trusted bases
  - Regular vulnerability scanning
  - Clear documentation of image contents
- **Severity**: Medium

## 3. Claude AI Integration Risks

### Anthropic API Terms
- **Risk**: Violating Anthropic's API terms of service
- **Key Restrictions**:
  - No reselling API access
  - No using Claude for illegal activities
  - No bypassing safety measures
  - Must comply with usage policies
- **Mitigation**:
  - Review and comply with Anthropic's ToS
  - Implement content filtering
  - Monitor agent usage patterns
- **Severity**: High

### Content Generation Liability
- **Risk**: AI-generated code causing damages
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clear disclaimers about AI-generated content
  - Human review recommendations
  - No warranty on AI output
  - Indemnification clauses in user agreement
- **Severity**: High

### Data Privacy with AI
- **Risk**: Sending user code/data to Anthropic API
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clear disclosure about data sent to AI
  - Option to opt-out of AI features
  - Data retention policies
  - Compliance with data protection laws
- **Severity**: Medium-High

## 4. General Platform Risks

### User Data Protection
- **Risk**: GDPR, CCPA compliance for user data
- **Requirements**:
  - Privacy policy
  - Data processing agreements
  - Right to deletion
  - Data portability
  - Security measures
- **Severity**: High

### Terms of Service Gaps
- **Critical Elements Needed**:
  - Acceptable use policy
  - Liability limitations
  - Indemnification
  - IP ownership clarity
  - Dispute resolution
  - Service level agreements

### SSH/VM Access
- **Risk**: Providing terminal access to VMs
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strong authentication
  - Audit logging
  - Network isolation
  - Clear acceptable use policy
  - Resource limits
- **Severity**: High

## 5. Specific Compliance Requirements

### Open Source Licenses
- Review all dependencies for license compatibility
- Provide attribution where required
- Comply with copyleft obligations if applicable

### Export Controls
- Claude AI may have export restrictions
- Cryptographic features (SSH) may require compliance

### Age Restrictions
- GitHub requires users to be 13+
- Consider COPPA compliance if applicable

## 6. Recommended Actions

### Immediate Priority
1. **Draft comprehensive Terms of Service** covering:
   - AI-generated content disclaimers
   - Limitation of liability
   - Acceptable use policy
   - IP ownership clarity

2. **Create Privacy Policy** addressing:
   - Data collection and usage
   - Third-party services (GitHub, Anthropic)
   - User rights and choices
   - Data retention and deletion

3. **Implement Security Measures**:
   - Container isolation and resource limits
   - API rate limiting
   - Webhook verification
   - Audit logging

### Medium-Term Actions
1. **Legal Review**:
   - Have attorney review ToS and Privacy Policy
   - Ensure compliance with relevant jurisdictions
   - Review third-party service agreements

2. **Insurance Considerations**:
   - Cyber liability insurance
   - Errors & omissions coverage
   - General liability

3. **Compliance Documentation**:
   - Data processing agreements with vendors
   - Security policies and procedures
   - Incident response plan

### Long-Term Considerations
1. **Regular Audits**:
   - Security assessments
   - License compliance reviews
   - ToS updates as services evolve

2. **User Agreements**:
   - Enterprise agreements for business users
   - SLAs for paid tiers
   - Data processing agreements for EU users

## 7. Risk Matrix

| Service | Risk Area | Likelihood | Impact | Overall Risk |
|---------|-----------|------------|--------|--------------|
| GitHub | API Abuse | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| GitHub | IP Violations | Low | High | Medium |
| Docker | Security Breach | Medium | High | High |

## 8. Disclaimer

This assessment provides general guidance only and should not be considered legal advice. Consult with qualified legal counsel to address specific legal requirements for your jurisdiction and use case.

## Summary

The primary legal risks center around:
1. **Liability for AI-generated content** - Need strong disclaimers
2. **Data privacy compliance** - Especially with third-party services
3. **Security incidents** - From container isolation or SSH access
4. **Terms of Service violations** - With GitHub, Docker, or Anthropic

Most risks can be mitigated through:
- Comprehensive Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
- Technical security measures
- Clear user consent and disclosure
- Regular compliance reviews
- Appropriate insurance coverage

Priority should be given to drafting proper legal agreements and implementing security controls before scaling the platform.
