## Server Features Implemented

### Express Server Configuration
✅ Express app with JSON parsing middleware  
✅ CORS configuration with environment-based origins  
✅ Static file serving from public directory  
✅ Rate limiting middleware (15min window, 100 requests/IP)  
✅ Comprehensive error handling middleware  
✅ 404 handler for unmatched routes  
✅ Health check endpoint at `/health`  

### Socket.io WebSocket Server
✅ WebSocket server with CORS configuration  
✅ JWT token-based authentication for socket connections  
✅ Team-based room management  
✅ Connection tracking with active user counts  
✅ Event handlers for:
  - `join-team` - Team room joining with authentication
  - `chat-message` - Real-time team messaging
  - `spawn-agent` - Agent creation via WebSocket
  - `stop-agent` - Agent termination
✅ Broadcast events for:
  - Team member connection/disconnection status
  - Agent status updates and output streaming
  - Chat message distribution

### API Routes Implementation

#### Authentication (`/api/auth`)
✅ `POST /register` - Create user and team with auto-generated team code  
✅ `POST /login` - User authentication with JWT token generation  
✅ `POST /join` - Join existing team using team code  
✅ Input validation with Zod schemas  
✅ Password hashing ready (bcrypt imported but not used per requirements)  

#### Agent Management (`/api/agents`) [JWT Protected]
✅ `POST /spawn` - Create new agent with type validation  
✅ `GET /list` - List user's agents with pagination  
✅ `GET /:id` - Get agent details with team permission checks  
✅ `POST /:id/stop` - Stop agent with ownership verification  
✅ Support for agent types: "general" and "code-writer"  
✅ Repository URL support for code-related tasks  

#### Team Management (`/api/team`) [JWT Protected]
✅ `GET /info` - Team details with member list  
✅ `GET /agents` - All team agents with ownership indicators  
✅ `GET /stats` - Team statistics (members, agents, activity)  
✅ Team-based permission system  

#### VM Management (`/api/vm`) [JWT Protected]
✅ `GET /status` - User's VM assignment status  
✅ `POST /assign` - Automatic VM assignment from pool  
✅ `POST /release` - VM deassignment  
✅ `GET /available` - VM availability overview (admin-style)  
✅ Mock VM pool with 5 instances for development  

### Database Integration
✅ Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL support  
✅ Database models for Team, User, Agent with proper relationships  
✅ Migration system ready  
✅ Seed data for development (demo team with users and agents)  
✅ Connection testing and graceful error handling  

### Development & Production Support
✅ TypeScript with strict type checking  
✅ ES modules configuration  
✅ Development server with hot reload (`npm run dev`)  
✅ Production build process (`npm run build`)  
✅ Comprehensive npm scripts for all operations  
✅ Environment variable configuration  
✅ Graceful shutdown handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)  

## Key Technical Details

### Port Configuration
- Default port: **3001**  
- Configurable via `PORT` environment variable  
- Frontend served from same port as API  

### Authentication System
- **JWT tokens** with 24-hour expiration  
- Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`  
- User context available in protected routes via `req.userId`  

### Database Schema
```sql
Team -> Users (1:many)
Team -> Agents (1:many)
User -> Agents (1:many)
User.vmId -> VM assignment (optional)
```

### WebSocket Architecture  
- Team-based rooms for collaboration  
- JWT authentication required for socket connections  
- Real-time agent output streaming  
- Connection status tracking  

### Error Handling
- Zod validation with detailed error responses  
- Database error handling with transaction support  
- HTTP status codes following REST conventions  
- Development vs production error detail levels  

## Startup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Configure environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update values  
3. **Set up database**: Run migrations and seeding  
4. **Start server**: `npm run dev` or `./start.sh`

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3001` with the API at `/api/*` endpoints.

## Next Steps

The server is fully functional and ready for:
1. Frontend integration
2. Database setup with PostgreSQL
3. Real AI agent integration (currently uses mock responses)
4. Production deployment configuration
5. Additional middleware (logging, monitoring)

All TypeScript compilation passes successfully, and the server follows modern Node.js best practices with ES modules and strict typing.
