MANUAL TEST: Read-Only Terminal Full Width and History
=======================================================

Prerequisites:
1. Server running on port 3001
2. Client running on port 3000
3. Two different user accounts created

Test Steps:
1. Login with User A (agent owner)
2. Spawn an agent with a task that generates output
3. Login with User B in another browser/incognito
4. User B joins the same team as User A
5. User B opens the terminal tile to view User A's agent

Expected Results:
✅ Terminal should use FULL WIDTH (not constrained to ~10 columns)
✅ History should be visible (all previous output shown)
✅ Live updates should work without duplicate lines
✅ Carriage returns (\\r) should update lines in place
✅ No ANSI escape sequences visible

Test Commands for Agent:
- Simple output: echo "This is a test message that should span the full width of the terminal"
- Progress updates: for i in {1..10}; do echo -ne "Progress: $i/10\\r"; sleep 1; done; echo ""
- Wide content: echo "================================================================================================"
- History test: Run multiple commands to build up history before User B connects

Debugging:
- Check browser console for WebSocket events
- Look for 'terminal_screen' events (processed output) for read-only viewers
- Look for 'terminal_data' events (raw output) for owners
- Server logs should show virtual terminal processing

Press Ctrl+C to exit when testing is complete.
