# ColabVibe: AI Workforce Management Platform
**"Spawn AI developers for your team from anywhere"**

---

## üöÄ The Problem: AI Development is Still Single-User

**Current AI tools are isolated and desktop-only:**

- **GitHub Copilot**: Personal assistant, desktop-only, single-user
- **Cursor**: Individual AI help, desktop-only, no team coordination
- **Claude/ChatGPT**: Solo conversations, no workspace access
- **Replit Agent**: One AI per project, desktop-only

**Result:** AI development doesn't scale across teams. Only the person at their desk can leverage AI.
